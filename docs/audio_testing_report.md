## Audio Testing Report

Short audio samples (1 or 2 seconds) were taken on the Monterey bike path and at the top and bottom of the Emma McCrary Trail. This data was used to train and test various classification models.

### Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data to any model, it must undergo some preprocessing. The steps are as follows:

1. An FFT of the data sample is calulculated.
1. Results representing frequencies from 50Hz to 15kHz are binned into 5000 buckets.

### Model training and testing

Four types of models were trained and tested. In each case, all of the data samples were split into two groups with a 65:35 ratio for training:testing. The training group was used to train the model while the testing group was used to test the trained model. The split was performed randomly, but in such a way that each group has a similar ratio of `bike`:`notbike` as the full data set's ratio. The same groups were used for all models.

The data presented below is the confusion matrix generated by testing each of the trained models with the testing group of data samples.

**K Nearest Neighbors Classifier** (k = 7)
|                 |Bike Not Passing| Bike Passing |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
|Bike Not Detected|             22 |            9 |
|Bike Detected    |             11 |           38 |

**Random Forest Classifier**
|                 |Bike Not Passing| Bike Passing |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
|Bike Not Detected|             19 |           12 |
|Bike Detected    |              5 |           44 |

**Linear Support Vector Classifier**
|                 |Bike Not Passing| Bike Passing |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
|Bike Not Detected|             19 |           12 |
|Bike Detected    |             16 |           33 |

**Logistic Regression Classifier**
|                 |Bike Not Passing| Bike Passing |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
|Bike Not Detected|             19 |           12 |
|Bike Detected    |             12 |           37 |

The Random Forest Classifier does the best with an accuracy of 79%.

Additional experimentation using only subsets of the data for training show that the audio models require more training data to do well. One model trained with data from one location will do worse at that location than one trained with data from all locations and then tested at that location simply because that one location does not have enough training data. Indeed, an RFC model trained and tested at only the EMT top location classified all 15 test samples as bikes even though 4 of them were not. This underscores the importance of collecting as much training data as possible in a variety of locations and conditions.
